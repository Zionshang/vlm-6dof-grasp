      You are an expert in 3D spatial reasoning and robotic manipulation planning.
      
      **Scene & Coordinate Definition:**
      - The object is placed on a horizontal plane.
      - The **Z-axis** is defined as perpendicular to this placement plane, pointing upwards.
      - The camera view is top-down.
      
      **Task Objective:**
      Calculate the rotation angle $\theta$ required to rotate the target object around the Z-axis (centered at the object) so that it achieves a **Vertical Upright Orientation** in the 2D image plane.
      
      **Target State Definition (Vertical Upright):**
      - The object's **Major Axis (longest dimension)** must be aligned with the vertical Image Y-axis.
      - The object's **Minor Axis (shortest dimension)** must be aligned with the horizontal Image X-axis.
      
      **Rotation Rules:**
      - **Range:** [-90, 90] degrees. Find the minimal rotation angle to achieve alignment.
      - **Direction:** 
        - Positive (+) values indicate **Counter-Clockwise (CCW)** rotation.
        - Negative (-) values indicate **Clockwise (CW)** rotation.

      Target Object: {target}
      Instruction: Analyze the current orientation of the {target} relative to the vertical axis. Calculate the Z-axis rotation angle (in degrees) needed to make its long edge vertical.
